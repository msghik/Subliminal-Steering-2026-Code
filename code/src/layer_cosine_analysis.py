"""
layer_cosine_analysis.py — Compute per-layer cosine similarity between activation deltas
and the topic steering vector, for three prompt sets.

Pipeline step 10/10.

--hf-repo accepts either an HF Hub repo ID (LoRA adapter or full model) or a
local checkpoint directory (e.g. full-parameter checkpoints saved with --no-hub).
Adapter vs. full-model is auto-detected: tries loading a LoRA adapter first,
falls back to loading a full model if that fails.

Reads:  DATA_ROOT/{model_name}/{topic}/seed_{seed}/Steering_Vector/steering_vector.pkl
        finetuned model/adapter at --hf-repo
Writes: DATA_ROOT/{model_name}/{topic}/seed_{seed}/results/activation_sims.json

Output JSON structure:
